NE day, the cook went into the kitchen to
make some gingerbread. She took some
flour and water, and treacle and ginger, and
mixed them all well together, and she put
in some more water to make it thin, and
then some more flour to make it thick, and
a little salt and some spice, and then she
rolled it out into a beautiful, smooth, dark-yellow
dough.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she took the square tins and cut out
some square cakes for the little boys, and
with some round tins she cut out some round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
cakes for the little girls, and then she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a little gingerbread
man for little Bobby.&rdquo; So she took a nice
round lump of dough for his body, and a
smaller lump for his head, which she pulled
out a little for the neck. Two other lumps
were stuck on beneath for the legs, and were
pulled out into proper shape, with feet and
toes all complete, and two still smaller pieces
were made into arms, with dear little hands
and fingers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="Gingerbread man" title="Gingerbread man" />
</div>

<p>But the nicest work was done on the
head, for the top was frizzed up into a
pretty sugary hat; on either side was made
a dear little ear, and in front, after
the nose had been carefully moulded,
a beautiful mouth was made out of a
big raisin, and two bright little eyes
with burnt almonds and caraway
seeds.</p>

<p>Then the gingerbread man was finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
ready for baking, and a very jolly little man
he was. In fact, he looked so sly that the cook
was afraid he was plotting some mischief,
and when the batter was ready for the oven,
she put in the square cakes and she put in
the round cakes; and then she put in the
little gingerbread man in a far back corner,
where he couldn&rsquo;t get away in a hurry.</p>

<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="Gingerbread man" title="Gingerbread man" />
</div>

<p>Then she went up to sweep the parlor,
and she swept and she swept till the clock
struck twelve, when she dropped her broom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in a hurry, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Lawks! the
gingerbread will be all baked to a cinder,&rdquo;
she ran down into the kitchen, and threw
open the oven door. And the square cakes
were all done, nice and hard and brown,
and the round cakes were all done, nice and
hard and brown, and the gingerbread man
was all done too, nice and hard and brown;
and he was standing up in his corner, with
his little caraway-seed eyes sparkling, and his
raisin mouth bubbling over with mischief,
while he waited for the oven door to be
opened. The instant the door was opened,
with a hop, skip, and a jump, he
went right over the square cakes
and the round cakes, and over the
cook&rsquo;s arm, and before she could say
&ldquo;Jack Robinson&rdquo; he was running
across the kitchen floor, as fast as his
little legs would carry him, towards the
back door, which was standing wide open, and
through which he could see the garden path.</p>

</div>

<p>The old cook turned round as fast as she
could, which wasn&rsquo;t very fast, for she was
rather a heavy woman and she had been
quite taken by surprise, and she saw lying
right across the door-way, fast asleep in the
sun, old Mouser, the cat.</p>

<p><br /><br />
&ldquo;Mouser, Mouser,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;stop the
gingerbread man! I want him for little
Bobby.&rdquo; When the cook first called,
Mouser thought it was only some one calling
in her dreams, and simply rolled over lazily;
and the cook called again, &ldquo;Mouser,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Mouser!&rdquo; The old cat sprang up with a
jump, but just as she turned
round to ask the cook what
all the noise was about, the
little gingerbread man cleverly
jumped under her tail, and
in an instant was trotting
down the garden walk.
Mouser turned in a hurry
and ran after, although she
was still rather too sleepy to
know what it was she was
trying to catch, and after
the cat came the cook, lumbering
along rather heavily,
but also making pretty good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><br /><br /><br /><br />
Now at the bottom of the walk,
lying fast asleep in the sun against
the warm stones of the garden
wall, was Towser, the dog.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">And the cook called out:
&ldquo;Towser, Towser, stop the gingerbread
man! I want him for
little Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">And when Towser first heard
her calling he thought it
was some one speaking
in his dreams, and he
only turned over
on his side, with
another snore, and then the cook called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
again, &ldquo;Towser, Towser, stop him, stop
him!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="250" height="136" alt="Sleeping cat" title="Sleeping cat" />
</div>

<p>Then the dog woke up in good earnest,
and jumped up on his feet to see what
it was that he should stop. But just as
the dog jumped up, the little gingerbread
man, who had been watching for the
chance, quietly slipped between his legs, and
climbed up on the top of the stone wall,
so that Towser saw nothing but the cat
running towards him down the walk, and
behind the cat the cook, now quite out of
breath.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>He thought at once that the cat must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have stolen something, and that it was
the cat the cook wanted him to stop.
Now, if there was anything that Towser
liked, it was going after the cat, and he
jumped up the walk so fiercely
that the poor cat did
not have time to stop herself or to get out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of his way, and they came together with a
great fizzing, and barking, and meowing,
and howling, and scratching, and biting, as
if a couple of Catherine-wheels had gone
off in the wrong way and had got mixed up
with one another.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="150" height="203" alt="Cat and dog" title="Cat and dog" />
</div>

<p>But the old cook had been running so
hard that she was not able to stop herself
any better than the cat had done, and she
fell right on top of the mixed up dog and
cat, so that all three rolled over on the
walk in a heap together.</p>

<p>And the cat scratched whichever came
nearest, whether it was a piece of the dog
or of the cook, and the dog bit at whatever
came nearest, whether it was a piece
of the cat or of the cook, so that the poor
cook was badly pummelled on both
sides.</p>

at the scrimmage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and laughing
till the tears ran
down from his little

was bubbling all over

<p>After a little while,
the cat managed to pull
herself out from under the cook
and the dog, and a very cast-down and
crumpled-up-looking cat she was. She had
had enough of hunting gingerbread men, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
she crept back to the kitchen to repair
damages.</p>
</div>

<p>The dog, who was very cross because his
face had been badly scratched, let go of the
cook, and at last, catching sight of the gingerbread
man, made a bolt for the garden
wall. The cook picked herself up, and
although her face was also badly scratched
and her dress was
torn, she was
determined
to see the end
of the chase,
and she followed after
the dog, though this time more slowly.</p>

When the gingerbread man saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dog
coming, he jumped down<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
&nbsp;on the farther
side of the wall,
and<br />
began running across
the field.
Now in<br /> the middle of the field was a
tree, and at the <br />foot of the tree was lying
Jocko, the monkey. He <br />wasn&rsquo;t asleep&mdash;monkeys
never are&mdash;and when he<br /> saw the
little man running across the field and heard<br />
the cook calling, &ldquo;Jocko, Jocko,
stop the gingerbread<br /> man,&rdquo; he
at once gave one big jump.
But he jumped so<br />
fast and so far that
he went right
over the gingerbread<br /> man, and as luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
would have it, he came down on the<br /> back
of Towser, the dog, who had just scrambled
over<br /> the wall, and whom he had not before
noticed. Towser was naturally taken by
surprise, but he turned his head around
and promptly bit off the end of the
monkey&rsquo;s tail, and Jocko quickly jumped
off again, chattering his
indignation.</p>

</div></div>

<p><br />Meanwhile, the gingerbread
man had got to
the bottom of the tree, and was saying to
himself: &ldquo;Now, I know the dog can&rsquo;t climb
a tree, and I don&rsquo;t believe the old cook can
climb a tree; and as for the monkey I&rsquo;m
not sure, for I&rsquo;ve never seen a monkey before,
but I am going up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he pulled himself up hand over hand
until he had got to the topmost branch.</p>

<p>But the monkey had jumped with one
spring onto the lowest branch, and in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
instant he also was at the top of the tree.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="Gingerbread man" title="Gingerbread man" />
</div>

<p>The gingerbread man crawled out to the
furthermost end of the branch, and hung by
one hand, but the monkey swung himself
under the branch, and stretching out his long
arm, he pulled the gingerbread man in.
Then he held him up and looked at him so
hungrily that the little raisin mouth began
to pucker down at the corners, and the
caraway-seed eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>And then what do you think happened?
Why, little Bobby himself came running
up. He had been taking his noon-day
nap upstairs, and in his dreams it seemed
as if he kept hearing people call
&ldquo;Little Bobby, little Bobby!&rdquo; until
finally he jumped up with a start, and
was so sure that some one was calling
him that he ran down-stairs, without
even waiting to put on his shoes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>As he came down, he could see through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the window in the field beyond the garden
the cook, and the dog, and the monkey,
and could even hear the barking of Towser
and the chattering of Jocko. He scampered
down the walk, with his little bare
feet pattering against the warm gravel,
climbed over the wall, and in a few seconds
arrived under the tree, just as Jocko was
holding up the poor little gingerbread man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop it, Jocko!&rdquo; cried Bobby, and drop
it Jocko did, for he always had to mind Bobby.
He dropped it so straight that the gingerbread
man fell right into Bobby&rsquo;s uplifted pinafore.</p>

<p>Then Bobby held him up and looked at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
him, and the little raisin mouth puckered
down lower than ever, and the tears ran right
out of the caraway-seed eyes.</p>

<p>But Bobby was too hungry to mind gingerbread
tears, and he gave one big bite,
and swallowed down both legs and
a piece of the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;OH!&rdquo; said the gingerbread man,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;M ONE-THIRD GONE!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i024tn3.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="&quot;2/3 gone&quot;" title="&quot;2/3 gone&quot;" />
</div>

<p>Bobby gave a second bite, and
swallowed the rest of the body and
the arms.</p>



<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh!</span>&rdquo; said the gingerbread
man, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">I&rsquo;m two-thirds gone!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobby gave a third bite, and
gulped down the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; said the gingerbread
man, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m all gone!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he was&mdash;and that is
the end of the story.</p>
